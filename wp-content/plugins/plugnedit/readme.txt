<strong>What is PlugNedit Fast Editor (Older Deprecated Version) </strong>

PlugNedit is a ready to use Adaptive WYSIWYG Visual Editor that has features of a word processor and desktop publisher. The HTML Editor is based on a 3D page building design with height, width and depth options available, standard online HTML editors are only based on 2D page editing design with height and width available. 


<strong>When to use Plugnedit?   Read!</strong>

Do not use PlugNEdit for simple pages or text layout, the WordPress editor will suite better for that.
Use PlugNedit for designer pages, text on graphics or graphical layout pages, plugNedit brings some of the features you would find in a expensive HTML visual builder for free.
